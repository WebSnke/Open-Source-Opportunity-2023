The amount of open-source interships, mentorships and fellowships is overwhelming.\
Which one should you choose?

This repository serves as a comprehensive table to find the perfect opportunity for you.\
Feel free to add a [new entry](https://github.com/WebSnke/Open-Source-Opportunity-2023/edit/2023/README.md). See [#Contribute](#contribute).

I recommend installing [GitHub Sort Content](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/21373-github-sort-content) on [Greasy Fork](https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/greasyfork) to sort through this table.\
You have to install [Tampermonkey (Firefox Add-On)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Violentmonkey (Chrome Extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) first though.

I also recommend [Wide GitHub](https://github.com/xthexder/wide-github) to make GitHub wide.\
Thanks [@Mottie](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/24847-mottie) and [@xthexder](https://github.com/xthexder) for these awesome extensions!
